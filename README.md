The first attempt file contains a novice's approach to the project. It is a very raw and rudimentary approach but an approach that got us started.

The second attempt file contains a more channeled and synchronized approach to our first acceptable model. 
The epochs, here, are kept low so that it can be checked thoroughly whether the model is working or not.

The third attempt is our submission code, though we would have loved to complete the fourth model.
The third attempt contains a lot of epochs with early stopping and gave us a healthy classification predictive strength
of about 93% with error of about 17%.

The fourth model has been uploaded just to provide a testament to our efforts to make a workable, hybrid
machine learning model. Though it did not completely work in our favour, but we are especially proud of our attempt on it.
We believe that with a bit of more finestrokes and better execution we can produce a model with a better classificative
strength and lower losses. It failed due to a lot of reasons, such as limited computational resources and unexpected errors
popping up after a good number of hours of training. Still, we will be working on after it, to hopefully, produce a respectable
model using it.
